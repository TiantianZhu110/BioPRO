Treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: effects of chenodeoxycholic acid, pravastatin, and combined use.

Treatments by oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) alone, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) alone, and combination of the two drugs were attempted for 7 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CDCA treatment at a dose of 300 mg/day reduced serum cholestanol (67. 3% reduction), lathosterol (50. 8%), campesterol (61. 7%) and sitosterol (12. 7%). However, the sera of the patients changed to be " atherogenic "; total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol were increased, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol was decreased. Contrarily, pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day improved the sera of the patients to be markedly " anti-atherogenic ", but the reductions of cholestanol (30. 4%), lathosterol (44. 0%), campesterol (22. 9%) and sitosterol (9. 6%) were inadequate. Combined treatment with CDCA and pravastatin showed good overlapping of the effects of each drug alone. The sera of the patients were apparently more " anti-atherogenic " than those after CDCA treatment. Serum cholestanol concentration was still 2. 7 times higher than in controls, but the serum lathosterol level was within the normal range, indicating that the enhancement of overall cholesterol synthesis in the patients was sufficiently suppressed. Plant sterol levels were also within the normal range. The combination of CDCA and pravastatin was a good treatment for CTX, based on the improvement of serum lipoprotein metabolism, the suppression of cholesterol synthesis, and reductions of cholestanol and plant sterol levels. In all of 7 patients, the progression of disease was arrested, but dramatic effects on clinical manifestations, xanthoma, and electrophysiological findings could not be found after the treatment of these drugs
