Color vision defects in adrenomyeloneuropathy.

The relationship between abnormal color vision and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) was investigated in 27 AMN patients and 31 age-matched controls by using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test. Twelve (44%) of 27 patients showed test scores significantly above normal. The axes of bipolarity determined by the testing differed widely between the patients with abnormal scores, compatible with the notion that different alterations in visual pigment genes occur in different AMN kindreds. These observations confirm our earlier impression that the frequency of abnormal color vision is increased in these kindreds, and it supports our contentions that (1) AMN (and its companion, adrenoleukodystrophy) are very closely linked to the visual pigment loci at Xq28 and (2) this proximity might provide the opportunity to observe contiguous gene defects..
