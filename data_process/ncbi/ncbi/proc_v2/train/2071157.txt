Determination of the mutations responsible for the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome in 17 subjects.

Hypoxanthine--guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) is a purine salvage enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate and guanine to guanosine monophosphate. Previous studies of mutant HPRT proteins analyzed at the molecular level have shown a significant heterogeneity. This investigation further verifies this heterogeneity and identifies insertions, deletions, and point mutations. The direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified product of reverse-transcribed HPRT mRNA enabled the rapid identification of the mutations found in 17 previously uncharacterized cell lines derived from patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome..
