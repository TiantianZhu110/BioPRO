Analbuminemia in a neonate.

A small-for-gestational-age infant, found to have analbuminemia in the neonatal period, is reported and the twelve cases recorded in the world literature are reviewed. Patients lacking this serum protein are essentially asymptomatic, apart from minimal ankle edema and ease of fatigue. Apparent compensatory mechanisms which come into play when serum albumin is low include prolonged half-life of albumin and transferrin, an increase in serum globulins, beta lipoprotein, and glycoproteins, arterial hypotension with reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure, and the ability to respond with rapid sodium and chloride diuresis in response to small volume changes. Examination of plasma amino acids, an investigation not previously reported, revealed an extremely low plasma tryptophan level, a finding which may be important in view of the role of tryptophan in albumin synthesis..
