Prenatal diagnosis of Wolman disease.

Two pregnancies at risk for Wolman disease were monitored by assay and electrophoresis of acid lipase in cultured amniotic-fluid cells. Cells from patient 1 had 5% of control levels of acid lipase, using 14C-triolein as substrate; however, when artificial substrates (esters of 4-methylumbelliferone and p-nitrophenol) were used to measure acid lipase, these cells had 30% of control levels. Electrophoresis of cell extracts revealed the absence of the A form of acid lipase, consistent with the diagnosis of Wolman disease. Analysis of fetal tissues following prostaglandin termination of this pregnancy confirmed the diagnosis. Assay of fetal-skin fibroblasts with 14C-triolein, as well as with artificial substrates, showed marked deficiency of acid lipase activity. Electrophoresis of fetal-tissue extracts also demonstrated the absence of the A form of acid lipase. Amniotic-fluid cells from patient 2 showed normal levels of acid lipase with all substrates tested; the electrophoretic pattern of acid lipase was normal. The results suggest that the prenatal diagnosis of Wolman disease be made using the radioassay of acid lipase and/or electrophoresis..
