The normal Huntington disease (HD) allele, or a closely linked gene, influences age at onset of HD.

We evaluated the hypothesis that Huntington disease (HD) is influenced by the normal HD allele by comparing transmission patterns of genetically linked markers at the D4S10 locus in the normal parent against age at onset in the affected offspring. Analysis of information from 21 sibships in 14 kindreds showed a significant tendency for sibs who have similar onset ages to share the same D4S10 allele from the normal parent. Affected sibs who inherited different D4S10 alleles from the normal parent tended to have more variable ages at onset. These findings suggest that the expression of HD is modulated by the normal HD allele or by a closely linked locus..
