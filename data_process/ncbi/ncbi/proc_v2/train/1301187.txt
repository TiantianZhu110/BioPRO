Molecular basis of phenylketonuria and related hyperphenylalaninemias: mutations and polymorphisms in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.

Mutations in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene producing phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups. These mutations all exhibit a high degree of association with specific restriction fragment-length polymorphism haplotypes at the PAH locus. About 50 of these mutations are single-base substitutions, including six nonsense mutations and eight splicing mutations, with the remainder being missense mutations. One splicing mutation results in a 3 amino acid in-frame insertion. Two or 3 large deletions, 2 single codon deletions, and 2 single base deletions have been found. Twelve of the missense mutations apparently result from the methylation and subsequent deamination of highly mutagenic CpG dinucleotides. Recurrent mutation has been observed at several of these sites, producing associations with different haplotypes in different populations. About half of all missense mutations have been examined by in vitro expression analysis, and a significant correlation has been observed between residual PAH activity and disease phenotype. Since continuing advances in molecular methodologies have dramatically accelerated the rate in which new mutations are being identified and characterized, this register of mutations will be updated periodically..
