Nephropathy in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

Nephropathy was detected in five of 32 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome who were participating in a study of transfer factor (TF) therapy. In two patients, nephropathy was present before TF and did not appear changed by TF therapy. One of these patients subsequently developed progressive renal failure requiring dialysis beginning 5 1/2 years after TF therapy. In two patients, decreased renal function appeared very soon after the administration of TF. One patient showed gradually decreasing renal function beginning after two years of TF therapy. An additional patient was identified who died with renal failure without having received TF. The results suggest that renal failure occurs in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome more frequently than generally recognized and that administration of TF may precipitate or accelerate the renal disease in patients with this syndrome..
