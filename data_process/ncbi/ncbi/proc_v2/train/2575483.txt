Autosomal dominant aniridia linked to the chromosome 11p13 markers catalase and D11S151 in a large Dutch family.

In a large pedigree with autosomal dominant aniridia, we found close linkage between the aniridia locus AN2 and the markers catalase (CAT) (zeta = 7. 27 at theta = 0. 00) and D11S151 (zeta = 3. 86 at theta = 0. 10) flanking the AN2 locus on 11p13. Positive lod scores were also obtained for the 11p13----11p14 markers D11S16 and FSHB with the linkage group CAT/AN2/D11S151. We conclude that the autosomal dominant aniridia in this family is due to a mutation at the AN2 locus on 11p13. We have excluded linkage (zeta less than -2 at theta less than 0. 18) between the aniridia and the chromosome 2p25 marker D2S1 (linked to ACP1).
