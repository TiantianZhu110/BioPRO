Heterogeneity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in Algeria. Study in Northern Algeria with description of five new variants.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was found in 3. 2% of the male population living in the urban area of Algiers. The deficient subjects originated from multiple geographic regions of Northern Algeria, with prevalence of individuals of Berber-Kabyle origin. Red blood cell G6PD was partially purified and characterized in deficient males from 17 families, and six different variants were found. Among them, only one, the Gd (-) Kabyle variant, had been previously described. It was detected in nine families. The other five variants were new  Gd (-) Laghouat (four cases), Gd (-) Blida (one case), Gd (-) Thenia (one case), Gd (-) Titteri (one case), and Gd (-) Alger (two brothers). Strikingly, the common Mediterranean variant was not found. G6PD deficiency is heterogeneous in northern Algeria where autochtonous variants seem to prevail. The Kabyle variant may be common in this country.
