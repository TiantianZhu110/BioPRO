Genomic organization of the UBE3A/E6-AP gene and related pseudogenes.

The UBE3A gene encodes the E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase and has recently been shown to be mutated in Angelman syndrome patients who lack 15q11-q13 deletions or chromosome 15 paternal uniparental disomy. Previous UBE3A cDNA analysis has shown a coding region of approximately 2. 6 kb and a 3-untranslated region (UTR) of < 50 bp, whereas Northern analysis has indicated mRNA sizes of 5-8 kb. We have analyzed additional cDNA clones and provide evidence for an additional 0. 5 kb of 5-UTR and > 2 kb of 3-UTR. We have established the genomic organization of UBE3A and the sequence of intron-exon borders. We have also mapped two highly homologous processed pseudogenes, UBE3AP1 and UBE3AP2, to chromosomes 2 and 21, respectively, and determined their genomic organization. These results will form the basis for studies of mutation and imprinting of UBE3A.
