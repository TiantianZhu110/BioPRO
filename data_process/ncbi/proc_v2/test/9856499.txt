Complement C7 deficiency: seven further molecular defects and their associated marker haplotypes.

Seven further molecular bases of C7 deficiency are described. All these new molecular defects involve single-nucleotide events, deletions and substitutions, some of which alter splice sites, and others codons. They are distributed along the C7 gene, but predominantly towards the 3 end. All were found in compound heterozygous individuals. The C6/C7 marker haplotypes associated with most C7 defects are tabulated..
