Nebulin and titin expression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy appears normal.

Monoclonal antibodies which recognize different epitopes on either titin or nebulin show normal staining patterns on frozen sections of three muscle biopsies of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting performed on two of these muscle biopsies show the normal pattern of titin and nebulin polypeptides. Since the donor of one of these biopsies has a large deletion of the 5-region of the DMD gene, our results argue against the recent proposal that nebulin is the gene mutated in DMD..
