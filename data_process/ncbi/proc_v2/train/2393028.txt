Molecular genetics of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) Mediterranean variant and description of a new G6PD mutant, G6PD Andalus1361A.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; E. C. 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy; more than 300 different biochemical variants of the enzyme have been described. In many parts of the world the Mediterranean type of G6PD deficiency is prevalent. However, G6PD Mediterranean has come to be regarded as a generic term applied to similar G6PD mutations thought, however, to represent a somewhat heterogeneous group. A C----T mutation at nucleotide 563 of G6PD Mediterranean has been identified by Vulliamy et al., and the same mutation has been found by De Vita et al. in G6PD Mediterranean, G6PD Sassari, and G6PD Cagliari. The latter subjects had an additional mutation, at nucleotide 1311, that did not produce a coding change. We have examined genomic DNA of five patients--four of Spanish origin and one of Jewish origin--having enzymatically documented G6PD Mediterranean. All had both the mutation at nucleotide 563 and that at nucleotide 1311. A sixth sample, resembling G6PD Mediterranean kinetically but with a slightly rapid electrophoretic mobility, was designated G6PD Andalus and was found to have a different mutation, a G----A transition at nucleotide 1361, producing an arginine-to-histidine substitution. These studies suggest that G6PD Mediterranean is, after all, relatively homogeneous.
