Linkage analysis of the apolipoprotein C2 gene and myotonic dystrophy on human chromosome 19 reveals linkage disequilibrium in a French-Canadian population.

The gene for human apolipoprotein C2 (APOC2), situated on the proximal long arm of chromosome 19, is closely linked to the gene for the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy (DM). Six APOC2 RFLPs (TaqI, BglI, BanI, BamHI, NcoI, and AvaII) have been identified to date. We have conducted a comprehensive DM linkage study utilizing all six RFLPs and involving 50 families and 372 individuals. The most informative RFLPs are, in descending order, NcoI (lod = 6. 64, theta = 0. 05), BglI (lod = 6. 12, theta = 0. 05), AvaII (lod = 6. 02, theta = 0. 03), BanI (lod = 5. 76, theta = 0. 04), TaqI (lod = 4. 29, theta = 0. 06), and BamHI (lod = 1. 75, theta = 0. 01). A substantial increase in the lod scores over those seen with the individual RFLPs was obtained when the linkage of the entire APOC2 haplotype (composed of the six RFLPs) was studied (lod = 17. 87, theta = 0. 04). We have observed significant inter-APOC2 RFLP linkage disequilibrium. Consequently, the three most informative RFLPs have been found to be BanI, TaqI, and either BglI, AvaII, or NcoI polymorphisms. We also demonstrate linkage disequilibrium between DM and APOC2 in our French-Canadian population (standardized disequilibrium constant phi =. 22, chi 2 = 5. 12, df = 1, P less than 0. 04). This represents the first evidence of linkage disequilibrium between APOC2 and the DM locus.
