Sialophorin, a surface sialoglycoprotein defective in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, is involved in human T lymphocyte proliferation.

The mAb L10 was used to determine the distribution and the function of sialophorin, the heavily glycosylated surface molecule that is deficient/defective in lymphocytes of patients with the X-linked immunodeficiency Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Dual-parameter FACS analysis indicated that sialophorin is expressed on CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes, on a subpopulation of peripheral blood B lymphocytes, on all thymocytes, and on a subpopulation of bone marrow cells. Functional studies demonstrated that L10 mAb stimulates the proliferation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes as measured by stimulation of [3H] thymidine incorporation. The time course and magnitude of increased [3H] thymidine incorporation by T lymphocytes in response to L10 mAb paralleled that induced by anti-CD3 mAb. Effective stimulation was dependent on the presence of monocytes and the Fc portion of L10 mAb. Stimulation of lymphocytes by L10, like stimulation by anti-CD3 mAb, involves increased expression of 4F2, HLA-DR, and IL-2-R. These observations suggest that sialophorin functions in T cell activation..
