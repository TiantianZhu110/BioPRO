Molecular detection of chromosomal translocations that disrupt the putative retinoblastoma susceptibility locus.

A candidate DNA sequence with many of the properties predicted for the retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB1) locus has been cloned (S. H. Friend, R. Bernards, S. Rogelj, R. A. Weinberg, J. M. Rapaport, D. M. Albert, and T. P. Dryja, Nature [London] 323  643-645, 1986). The large size of this gene (ca. 200 kilobases [kb]) and its multiple dispersed exons (Wiggs et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 318  151-157, 1988) complicate molecular screening strategies important in prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis and in carrier detection. Here we used field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) to construct a restriction map of approximately 1, 000 kb of DNA surrounding the RB1 locus and to detect the translocation breakpoints in three retinoblastoma patients. DNA probes from either the 5 or 3 end of the gene were used to detect a 250-kb EagI restriction fragment in DNA from unaffected individuals. Both probes identified an additional hybridizing fragment in the DNA from each patient, permitting the breakpoints in all three to be mapped within the cloned RB1 gene. Analysis of the breakpoint in one translocation cell line allowed the RB1 gene to be oriented with its 5 end toward the centromere. The 5 end of the gene also appeared to be associated with a clustering of sites for several infrequently cleaving restriction enzymes, indicating the presence of an HpaII tiny fragment island. The detection and mapping of the translocation breakpoints of all three retinoblastoma patients to within the putative RB1 gene substantiated the authenticity of this candidate sequence and demonstrated the utility of FIGE in detecting chromosomal rearrangements affecting this locus.
