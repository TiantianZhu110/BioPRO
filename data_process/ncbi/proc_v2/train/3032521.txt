Re-evaluation of the sublocalization of esterase D and its relation to the retinoblastoma locus by in situ hybridization.

In situ hybridization of a cDNA probe for the esterase D gene (ESD) was carried out on human chromosomes. The probe hybridized most strongly to 13q14. 2 and 13q14. 3. This observation raises doubts concerning the most recently published assignment of ESD to 13q14. 1. A deletion in an individual with retinoblastoma was reported to separate the closely linked ESD and retinoblastoma (RB1) loci, placing ESD proximal to RB1. Quantitative in situ hybridization studies of this deletion do not confirm this interpretation. Rather, they suggest that ESD is missing from the deleted chromosome 13 and duplicated on the normal homolog. From these findings, we conclude that the deletion in this individual cannot be used to determine the orientation nor the sublocalization of ESD and RB1 within the 13q14 region.
