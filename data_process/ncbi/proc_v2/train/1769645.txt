Aberrant splicing of phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA: the major cause for phenylketonuria in parts of southern Europe.

We report a mutation within the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene that causes aberrant splicing of the mRNA and that is in tight association with chromosomal haplotypes 6, 10, and 36. Because of the high frequency of these particular haplotypes in Bulgaria, Italy, and Turkey, it appears to be one of the more frequent defects in the PAH gene causing classical phenylketonuria in this part of Europe. The mutation is a G to A transition at position 546 in intron 10 of the PAH gene, 11 bp upstream from the intron 10/exon 11 boundary. It activates a cryptic splice site and results in an in-frame insertion of 9 nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mRNA. Normal amounts of liver PAH protein are present in homozygous patients, but no catalytic activity can be detected. This loss of enzyme activity is probably caused by conformational changes resulting from the insertion of three additional amino acids (Gly-Leu-Gln) between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11..
